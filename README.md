# Rebolt - BuckleScript bindings for React Native (for nowâ„¢)

_First of all we would like to thank ReasonML Community for starting the [`bs-react-native`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) project, and thanks to its MIT license we can continue exploring our ideas starting on the solid foundation!_

## Rebolt v1.0

The phase 1 (bindings) is done for us so we decided to contribute back what we've learnt to the community and the project [`(bs-react-native)`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) that earlier allowed us to start our experimentation on the great foundation. We strongly encourage you to build your apps using [`(bs-react-native)`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) bindings from now.

## Plan

All the code from [`Rebolt's`](https://github.com/callstackincubator/rebolt) master branch is going to be removed and the future development is going to happen on v2 branch.

## Rebolt v2.0

In version v2 we would like to do quite a few breaking changes, and this will be the place were we explore different ideas that we have for the new API.
Think about it as React Native built in Reason.
