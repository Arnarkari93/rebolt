_First of all we would like to thank ReasonML Community for starting the [`bs-react-native`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) project, and thanks to its MIT license we can continue exploring our ideas starting on the solid foundation!_

## Getting started

Please see the documentation on the [website](https://rebolt.callstack.com).

## Why forking?

We decided to fork [`bs-react-native`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) as in the meantime of completing the bindings we also want to experiment on something new that could allow us to have a better API than what currently React Native gives us.

## Plan

### Rebolt v1 (for now™)

Our plan for the stable v1 is to complete the missing bindings and create as many docs to lower the barrier of entry for people to try out Reason in their React Native apps. Everything up to version 1 will always be bindings for React Native.

### Rebolt v2

In version v2 we would like to do quite a few breaking changes, and this will be the place were we explore different ideas that we have for the new API.
Think about it as React Native built in Reason.
