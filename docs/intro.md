_Currently this is a fork of [`bs-react-native`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native)_

**Rebolt** - (for nowâ„¢) BuckleScript bindings for React Native.

This library is experimental, so if you feel adventurous feel free to use it.

## Why forking?

We decided to fork [`bs-react-native`](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-react-native) as in the meantime of completing the bindings we also want to experiment on something new that could allow us to have a better API than what currently React Native gives us. Think about it as React Native built in Reason, but that's the aim for v2. In the meantime, it will be our version of bindings for React Native.
