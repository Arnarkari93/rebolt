## Notes

At this meeting we are discussing what else we have left to be able to release the v1 in the next two weeks.

We are missing @grabbou today as he went to represent us and spread a word about Rebolt at the [Chain React Conference](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf).

In the past two weeks we have managed to create a few missing bindings, tidy up the docs and remove the unused code.
